This is meant to be a short blog post on the process I went through to revamp my personal website. I'll walk through some of the design decisions as well as some of the mistakes ( At times horrendous ) that I made.

The previous iteration of my home page was hosted on Heroku. For those who don't know how heroku works, it's a PaaS( Platform as a service ). Now this is a handy tool for people who don't have their own infrastructure to deploy production applications. It's very similar to AWS in that regard except that it abstracts away many of the nitty gritty details that AWS requires to configure deployment of an application.

Long story short, I chose Heroku because of its convenience factor and because I was on the Developer plan that was completely free! So I built my website
