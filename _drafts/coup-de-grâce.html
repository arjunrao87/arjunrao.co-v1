<p style="text-align:center;">“There is no failure except in no longer trying.”</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">- Chris Bradford</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Disclaimer : I had no idea who Chris Bradford was, but this quote resonated with me, quite profoundly, and thus it finds its way as the opening statement to this post.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">If you were to peruse any sort of literature, be it historical or contemporary, you will find a multitude of trite sayings or expressions, all pointing out the value of failure. How failure is acceptable. How it is a stepping stone to achieving that greatness, that is oh-so-close if you put in the effort. How failing is the only way of succeeding at something. I don't intend to buttress this argument by adding any truisms of my own.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">What I do intend to do, however, is highlight a problem that I have been facing in the past few years. A terrible enchantment that I intend to break, or atleast that is the hope. I speak of the Coup de grace.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">DONT MAKE THIS PURELY ABOUT TECHNICAL PROJECTS.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Art, Photography, Physical fitness, Computer projects, hobbies, social good, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:left;">you dont actually believe the idea is of any use practically</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">not being able to set deadlines/goals</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Not having enough feedback</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">not realizing instant achievements. feeding the egotistic part of the brain ( like going to the gym. with all the seratonin )</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">just not feeling competent enough, self doubt. is it even unique, whats the point of things.tried something before bu</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">no stakes involved. not money, not life</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">its just so easy to not do it, watch netflix instead or go out to the park. or for fitness, why go through the mental and physical pain. its like torture.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;"> lack of self discipline</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">the little things to be done are just so boring. like post processing photos. waiting for the photos for hours at end. making small irrelevant bug fixes</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">setting unrealistic expectations both for timeline completion of projects as well as the intended result. dont let the focus of the thing be billions of dollars. not gonna happen.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">lack of focus. jumping around like a housefly wihtout finishing any one thing * dont start new things without finishing existing things</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">laws of inertia ( whats halted is halted, what moves moves )</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">our attention spans are getting shorter and shorter. as is shown by the success of youtube videos over long shows etc. its getting increasingly hard to focus</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">hitting the "Writers block"</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">unhappiness at not getting things done, instead of being an incentive to finish tasks up, ends up creating a feedback loop of not getting shit done. its not constructive unhappiness.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">---------------------------------</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">having a grading system like college. GPA wise.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">having a mentor/challenger</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">doing projects with a partner</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">putting money on the line</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">pretend its an enterprise project</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">create small realizable goals with active results. do things like a/b testing</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">put reputation on line by telling people about it</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">surround yourself with ppl who get shit done</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">dont surround yourself with people who talk negatively about getting stuff done</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">dont fuss over details. dont be a perfectionist. just do it.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">constant never ceasing vigilance and discipline ( iron fist ) ( having timelines okrs etc )</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">know when to stop working on an idea. dont run the idea into the ground and then realize you spent too much time on it ( "succesful ppl give up too. the give up on failed ideas")</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Record all ideas. even if you arent getting things done today, there is no reason you wont get to them at "some" point. dont let those ideas be lost</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">deliver small things quickly to build up self-confidence</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Parallelizing multiple goals together ( if they are of different streams ) v/s having ONE goal to be completed. both approaches are interesting. give arguments.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:left;">talk about human brain and how you can just trick your braiun into doing something that it doesnt know its doing. quote kaku?</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">media: shia le bouf video</p>
<p>words : piece de resistance, recherche,<strong> joie de vivre, intellection</strong></p>
<p>Seeing projects to the end. how to create incentive to complete projects?</p>
