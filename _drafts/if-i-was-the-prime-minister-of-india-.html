<p>// Remove the fact that you want to be prime minister. More like country evangelist who is able to impact change and not beholden to the lobbying and bureaucracies that come with governmental services. this is more about what changes you want to see than HOW you want to get them done. maybe all this is "if i had a blank slate"</p>
<p>// The present is history happening over and over again.</p>
<p>One of my most vivid memories of my school curriculum as a kid, was a piece that we are asked to write on the topic "If I was the Prime Minister of India". Now sure I could go on some memory rant about what I wrote at the time, but the truth is I have no recollection of the content. I do, however, want to make sure that my ideals for the country as of now, as its most powerful citizen, do not get lost in the sands of time.</p>
<p>I have to be honest, I am ensorcelled by power. I have been asked the question before, whether I place more importance in money or power, and I have unabashedly always replied with the latter. Money is ephemeral. It is here today and gone the next day. It is a zero sum game. Any changes effected with money are topical  and are ostensibly superficial. Well, I do not want to undersell the causality that money can have with societal improvement, but I want to say that in comparison to power, it might seem like its diminished counterpart.</p>
<p>While it might seem like I am digressing, I hope it serves as the underpinning for the reason I am writing about this particular topic. Through the course of this piece, I want to outline concrete steps across all functions of society/life that I would take, should I ever attain the highest political office in the country. ( Fans of the office of the president might want to avoid that last line entirely ).</p>
<p>//write about magna carta?</p>
<p>Disclaimers :</p>
<p>- I might seem hypocritical.</p>
<p>- I have no poli-sci background. No legislative/judicial/military bg. No religious/literature bg.</p>
<p>- Politics is controversial. No one will agree with me  perhaps. theres that.</p>
<p>- Most of this is not realizable due to the way politics works in india and the way ppl think</p>
<p>- maybe not practical because of the way society is structured and these plans arent for a society like india. part of this is my utopian society, part of it is for india</p>
<p>- maybe modi is trying to do this, but dont know where the message gets lost in translation. Either he is doing good and we are yet to see it, or he isnt doing anything and just chilling. or he is trying to do good but is unable to because of bureaucracy.</p>
<p>-But i am gonna go ahead and speak on each of these issues anyway.</p>
<p>Need transparency. PM doesnt need to answer to anyone. No oversight. Even school teachers / employees have oversight. Analogous to employees being allowed to coast for 5 years and then let go.</p>
<p>// Need to do research on numbers for each of the sections etc. John oliver style.</p>
<p>// Also draw from other country implementations of social/other programs</p>
<p>// Need to look up on what are the different departments within the government and where the excess fat can be cut</p>
<p>0. What are my high-level views? ( free markets, capitalism/communism, free speech, privitization etc )</p>
<p>A. High level</p>
<p>1. Tax code ( Refunds etc ). Abolish income tax and have flat tax. get rid of auditors and</p>
<p>2. Infrastructure ( building bridges, roads, tunnels, highways, trains, airports, railway stations, subways, metros, dams )</p>
<p>- need to be able to fastrack projects and stick to deadlines and not have bloated ever increasing budgets. it isnt tolerable when you ask a painter to paint your house and he takes 10 years and keeps increasing his costs, then why is it ok to build a metro for 10 years?</p>
<p>3. Border security ( Building roads, fortifications )</p>
<p>4. Closer ties with SAARC, APAC, ASEAN nations. Have a euro-zone like region without currency entanglements.</p>
<p>5. Education programs</p>
<p>6. Private sector v/s public sector</p>
<p>7.  get rid of Censorship boards</p>
<p>8. Improving military equipment</p>
<p>9. Improving police forces/prison system etc. FIRs against SRK etc. ughh</p>
<p>10. Improving special forces and boosting counter intelligence</p>
<p>11. Revamp the energy grids. Privatize it. keep control of the major power grids but lease them out.</p>
<p>12. stop trying to compare with singapore, china etc. there is plenty of smart ppl with the right ideas. india is unique. trust our own people to build the right frameworks.</p>
<p>13. Planned cities ( is it possible? ). Or bring organization to places like mumbai/bangalore. ( this is probably another post because of the whole 'organization to chaos' theme).Creating new cities JUST for the purpose of things like making a financial city/technology city etc WONT work. History shows it has always failed.</p>
<p>14. State of the union-esque report cards so that we know what is being done. on an annual basis. not just grandstanding. cold hard facts. pros and cons.</p>
<p>15. get rich people to adopt highways/etc  for upkeep. involve rich ppl in donation</p>
<p>16. solve the population problem somehow. dubai has solved the heat problem. that was going nowhere</p>
<p>17. Transparency. Transparency. Transparency.</p>
<p>18. Water cleaning measures ( rivers, lakes, ponds etc )</p>
<p>19. Change psyche of people against littering, spitting throwing stuff. Become german robots.</p>
<p>20.Solve the hobo/homeless issue</p>
<p>21. Slums/Shanties issue. eg mumbai airport. stop the votebank politics</p>
<p>B. Common-man issues( some of this is not the PMs prerogative but it is somethign someone needs to work out )</p>
<p>1.  Rapes and attitude towards women</p>
<p>2. Traffic( Parisian way of banning cars and making public transportation free ). REDUCE traffic. increase public transportation.</p>
<p>3. Making tourism within india sexy</p>
<p>- Developing roads and rest stops to make long distance road trips viable</p>
<p>- Developing cutting edge websites with up-to-date information</p>
<p>- Developing infrastructure for national parks like in the US and making things tourist friendly</p>
<p>- Create culture centers and make all these monuments etc more accessible. make them online. Prevent loitering like the gateway of india.</p>
<p>4. Broadband and wireless/fiber internet of highest speeds</p>
<p>5. Boosting community initiatives like farmers market etc.</p>
<p>6. Encourage grass root participation in society improvement and community improvement. CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH</p>
<p>7. Eliminate bureaucracy and red tape. Whether local government/ national government etc.</p>
<p>8. Get rid of the telephone exchanges. Privatize it. No need for mtnl, bsnl and other bs</p>
<p>9. Emergency services like 911. ( for fire/health/cops etc )</p>
<p>10. Health insurance like the NHS in great britain. NOT the usa.</p>
<p>11. Improve the quality of zoos and animal shelters. Massive wildlife preservation initiatives.</p>
<p>12. Stray dogs/cats/pigs/buffaloes/cows should be impounded</p>
<p>13. Massive tree planting and greenery initiatives. MASSIVE.</p>
<p>14. encourage venture capitalism and startup zones</p>
<p>15. Reduce bureaucracy at government banks. Clean up shop</p>
<p>16. Prohibit copying at schools etc. Make it a stigma. Stop all this leaking of exam papers. ughhhh</p>
<p>17. eliminate bribery COMPLETELY. this is IMPOSSIBLE to get rid of but not IMPROBABLE. everyone bribes. it makes life simple but it is very short term.</p>
<p>18. Tidy roads up. The little things at the corner left incomplete MUST BE COMPLETED. Make the cops accompany the construction crews. Make sure they use the best materials available.</p>
<p>19. Garbage disposal needs to be frequent and regular and segregated(recycle/garbage etc )</p>
<p>20. Personal gifts, statues, etc all banned</p>
<p>21. No vigilantes, public taking law into their hands</p>
