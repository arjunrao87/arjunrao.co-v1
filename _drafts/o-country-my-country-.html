<div style="text-align:center;">O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,</div>
</div>
<div style="text-align:center;">The ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won,</div>
<div style="text-align:center;">The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,</div>
<div style="text-align:center;">While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and</div>
<div style="text-align:center;">But O heart! heart!</div>
<div style="text-align:center;">O the bleeding drops of</div>
<div style="text-align:center;">Where on the deck my Captain</div>
<div style="text-align:center;">Fallen cold and dead.</div>
<p>These words have been immortalized by Walt Whitman and need no introduction. I do, however, want to use these words as a metaphor for what I believe is happening to my homeland.</p>
<p>We are a nation, old and proud. Old in our heritage, proud in our demeanor. There are few civilizations that can claim to be older than ours, yet none that match our diversity of thoughts and peoples. We are the land of epics like Mahabharat and Ramayana,  kings and emperors such as Ashoka the Great and Akbar the Great, pacifists like the Mahatma, scholars like Aryabhatta and C.V. Raman, thinkers like Amartya Sen, flavors of food unmatched and home to a host of religions. We are polyglots and polytheists and we could, and we have to some extent,  paint the world red with our  sheer determination to achieve goals. I could wax eloquent about my land, to no seeming end, but I must change tracks to put the spotlight on where I think our country fails.</p>
<p>Due to the nature and gravity of this post, I feel obliged to throw out a few disclaimers.</p>
<p>First and foremost, I want to say, in no uncertain terms, that I love my country and would do anything for it, should the need arise. I do not currently reside in  India, as a result, many a times has the thought crossed my mind "Do I still have the right to comment on the state of affairs of a country that I willingly chose to walk away from?". I have battled this thought several times and yet I have come to the conclusion that, in this moment, I only have my thoughts. With these thoughts I will try to shape the utopian state I dream for my country. If nothing, at least it cannot be said that I did not consider this.</p>
<p>Secondly, this post is not directed towards an individual or community. It's sole target is the society as a whole and I while I might be presumptuous, I certainly hope everyone is open to honest criticism. Some of the ideas, might be a problem with humanity in general, but I'll try and provide some concrete examples to show how they apply to us.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if I propose betterment to a certain idea/program, that I may have picked from some other society, it should certainly not be assumed that I wholeheartedly agree with every single viewpoint of that society. My goal here is to pick the best ideas and see how it could benefit my country.</p>
<p>Lastly, this is an opinion. It is mine and mine alone. The reader does not have to agree with my thoughts or even pay any heed. If comments are made, I request that they be made in the right spirit. I am always open to an engaging debate of ideas.</p>
<p>Now that my guilt is apparent, I shall march on ahead with what I believe is flawed in our society, as things stand.</p>
<p>I like to think I am objective in my thinking and consider many, if not all, points of view that there are to an argument. As a result, through the course of my polemic, I will try to play Devil's advocate to my own statements, but I want to assure you that there is no vacillation with regard to my position.  I will segregate my writing into sections to give specific reasoning about why I am thinking what I am thinking. It will also perhaps serve as a tl;dr for the hasty. If my writing seems to be aggressive and angry, it is because it is a product of me. I am angry and aggressive about the goings-on in India.</p>
<p>Section 1 : Intransigence</p>
<p>To begin my harangue, we are held hostage by the same things that made our splendorous rise possible.  We cling too strongly to beliefs of old, even if they aren't relevant in the present.</p>
<p>Section 2 : Lack of self-introspection and self-critique</p>
<p>Section 3 : Inability to take the tough decisions</p>
<p>Section 4 : Gridlock in political decisions</p>
<p>Section 5 : Rampant corruption</p>
<p>Section 6 :</p>
